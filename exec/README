This program depends on the t8code library (branch: feature-fix_include_installs).
t8code can be found at https://github.com/holke/t8code.

Install t8code as an external library in a folder.

Edit the entries BASE_DIR and T8_DIR in the file ./exec/compile.

To compile the t8dg program and the t8dg_test
the first step is to build the Googletest library:

cd lib
make
cd ..

Now compile the binaries with

source compile

The source call is necessary to export the correct t8code library.
In subsequent calls, only ./compile is necessary.
