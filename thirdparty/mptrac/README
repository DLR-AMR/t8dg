To use mptrac with t8dg you need to

 - link t8dg against netcdf using --with-netcdf
 - manually link t8dg against gsl and gslcblas using LDFLAGS (-L), LIBS (-l) and CPPFLAGS (-I)
 - enable openmp

Here is an example configure line in debugging mode using MPI:

configure \
	CFLAGS="-Wall -O0 -g -pedantic" \
	CXXFLAGS="-Wall -O0 -g -pedantic" \
	--enable-mpi --enable-debug \
	--enable-static --disable-shared \
	CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx \
	LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/gsl/lib -L/optional/path/to/netcdf/lib" \
	CPPFLAGS="-I/path/to/gsl/include -I/optional/path/to/netcdf/include" \
	LIBS="-lgsl -lgslcblas" \
	--with-netcdf \
	--enable-openmp \
	--prefix=/path/to/t8dg/install_target

Note that the netcdf lib and include paths need to be provided if they are in a non-standard directory.

An application must add libtrac as additional dependency.
